'''
So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of 3:

    After one day, its internal timer would become 2.
    After another day, its internal timer would become 1.
    After another day, its internal timer would become 0.
    After another day, its internal timer would reset to 6, and it would create a new lanternfish with an internal timer of 8.
    After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of 5, and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of 7.

    A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to 6, not 7 (because 0 is included as a valid timer value).
    The new lanternfish starts with an internal timer of 8 and does not start counting down until the next day.
